# MSRP Verification system
Users can link their Discord account with their Minecraft account by joining the MSRP.at server and then entering the /verify command. 
This will provide them a verify code which they need to enter in the Discord verify channel. Once this step is completed, they can use the Discord and also receive their Minecraft name as a discord nickname.
